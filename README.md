# C# Snippets
Since I started making [my game](https://tof.sweptthr.one), I've been using C# as my "problem-solving language."  
Previously, JavaScript via Node was my go-to for this kinda thing, but that was always kinda annoying.  
  
In this repository are **source files only**, these are **not** full projects.  Set up your own!  
Each file has a comment header telling you the setup I used for the project.  

## Access Log Parser
I posted a YouTube video showing off fake cheats for a game and included a fake download link.  
This program parses a raw access log generated by my web server.  
It finds every visit to my "download page" from YouTube and adds the visiting IP to a file.  
The resulting file is a .cheatwanters file with one IP per line.  
I made this just to laugh at how many people want cheats.  I don't do anything else with the data.  

## GMod Weapon Unpacker
This program takes all Garry's Mod SWep folders in a given folder and "unpacks" them.  
Weapon files that are structured like weapons/classname/shared.lua are unpacked to weapons/classname.lua.  
This makes it easier to open multiple weapon files at one time.  

## Roman Numeral Translator
This program translates any given Arabic number to Roman Numerals.  
I can't comment on the efficiency or optimization of this one, but it works.

## NPC-Playermodel Translator  
This program recursively searches all subfolders of the input folder and edits QC files.  
It removes NPC-specific sequences and animations, and replaces any includemodel  
statements with the one needed for playermodels.  
This one is poorly-written, but it gets the job done, at least for the NPC pack I used.
